# BSODTRIPWIRE
A tripwire that causes a bsod after any input.

You can see that theres a bsod.h file. It has a function called bsod and that function causes a bsod if not log is defined then it will log if it should cause a bsod. feel free to use it!

There are 2 versions bsod and bsodc the latter one is written in c++ and the first one is written in assembly (smaller file size)

I used the golink linker for dynamic linking and small file size

dependencies
for assembly version
nasm
golink (I included it)

for c++ version
g++


I do not stand responsible for any damages caused. I made this as a troll if anything happens do not blame me you agreed to using this software.
